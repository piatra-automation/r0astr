    AC4: "PASS - Manual visual regression testing confirms identical rendering"
    AC5: "PASS - 8 inline styles removed, replaced with CSS classes"

# Notes
notes: |
  Excellent execution of CSS extraction refactoring. Developer demonstrated:
  - Attention to detail (preserved CSS structure exactly as specified)
  - Proper use of semantic CSS classes (.hidden, .capture-controls label, etc.)
  - Adherence to naming conventions (kebab-case)
  - Comprehensive manual testing across browsers

  No code quality issues found. No refactoring required during QA review.

  Single area for future improvement: Establish automated visual regression testing
  to reduce manual testing burden for future UI changes. This is a project-wide
  concern, not specific to this story.
