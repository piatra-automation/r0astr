quality_score: 100

code_quality_assessment:
  implementation: EXCELLENT
  notes: |
    - Clean vanilla JavaScript implementation using ES modules
    - Proper use of Map for listener storage (better performance than Object)
    - All methods correctly implemented (on, emit, off)
    - Singleton pattern with separate class export for testing
    - Comprehensive JSDoc with @param, @returns, @example annotations
    - File header documentation with usage examples
    - Namespaced event naming convention documented
    - No external dependencies (vanilla JS only)
    - Follows coding standards:
      * 2-space indentation
      * camelCase naming
      * Single quotes for strings
      * Semicolons required
      * ES modules (import/export)

manual_testing:
  test_suite: "test-eventbus.html"
  test_cases: 4
  tests_passing: 4
  coverage:
    - "Test 1: Basic event emission and listener callback"
    - "Test 2: Multiple listeners for same event"
    - "Test 3: Remove listener functionality"
    - "Test 4: Complex data object passing"
  notes: "All tests passing in browser - user confirmed successful execution"

design_decisions:
  strengths:
    - "Map over Object for better performance and insertion order preservation"
    - "Silent no-op on emit() to non-existent events (standard pub/sub pattern)"
    - "Callback reference equality for off() (standard JavaScript pattern)"
    - "Namespaced event naming (component:action) for clarity"
  observations:
    - "No input validation (e.g., callback must be function) - acceptable for internal utility"
    - "No error handling for invalid inputs - intentional design choice for simplicity"

recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Consider adding optional error handling mode for debugging"
      details: "Could add development-mode validation to catch programmer errors (e.g., passing non-function to on())"
