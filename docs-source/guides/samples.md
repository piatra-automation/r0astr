## Overview

r0astr uses Strudel's built-in sample library by default. This guide explains how to use custom samples.

## Built-in Samples

Strudel includes a large library of samples. Common ones include:

| Sample | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `bd` | Bass drum |
| `sd` | Snare drum |
| `hh` | Hi-hat |
| `cp` | Clap |
| `noise` | White noise |

Use numbered variants for different sounds:
```javascript
s("bd:0 bd:1 bd:2 bd:3")
```
