## Your First Pattern

Let's make some noise.

### Step 1: Find Panel 1

You'll see several panels on screen. Each panel is an independent instrument. Find **Panel 1**.

### Step 2: Enter a Pattern

Click in the editor and paste this drum pattern:

```javascript
s("bd*4, ~ sd ~ sd, hh*8").gain(0.8)
```

!!! info "What does this mean?"
    - `s("...")` plays **samples** (sounds)
    - `bd*4` = bass drum 4 times
    - `~ sd ~ sd` = snare on beats 2 and 4 (`~` is silence)
    - `hh*8` = hi-hat 8 times
    - `.gain(0.8)` = volume at 80%

### Step 3: Hit Play

Click the **Play** button on Panel 1. You should hear a basic drum beat!

!!! success "Congratulations!"
    You just wrote your first live coding pattern.

---

## Add a Second Instrument

Now let's layer in some bass.

### Step 1: Find Panel 2

Leave Panel 1 playing. Find **Panel 2**.

### Step 2: Enter a Bass Pattern

Paste this into Panel 2:

```javascript
note("c2 ~ c2 e2").s("sawtooth").lpf(400).gain(0.6)
```

!!! info "What does this mean?"
    - `note("...")` plays **synth notes**
    - `c2`, `e2` = notes (C and E, octave 2)
    - `.s("sawtooth")` = sawtooth wave synth
    - `.lpf(400)` = low-pass filter at 400Hz
    - `.gain(0.6)` = volume at 60%

### Step 3: Hit Play on Panel 2

Click Play. The bass joins the drums — perfectly in sync!

---

## Try More Patterns

Add these to Panels 3 and 4:

### Panel 3: Melody

```javascript
n("0 2 3 5 3 2").scale("C4:minor").s("triangle").gain(0.5)
```

### Panel 4: Ambient Pad

```javascript
n("0 3 7").scale("C3:minor").s("sawtooth").lpf(600).room(0.8).slow(4).gain(0.4)
```

Now you have a full arrangement with drums, bass, melody, and ambient texture!

## What You've Learned

- Panels are independent instruments
- `s()` plays samples, `note()` plays synths
- All panels share the same clock (they stay in sync)
- Play/Pause controls each panel independently
