## UI TWEAKS
- CSS site definitions for hole bkg and rounding effects.
KEYBORD MAYBE USEFUL: https://codepen.io/evilpaper/pen/dyyZjLQ


- [ ] div modal-footer is black. the whole page should be rendered to look like our interface.



- [ ] expanding collapsed window seems to reset stored collapse state to small size (default) even when viz+sliders are present. or the collapsed window was resized to account for controls. any expansion of the panel seems to reset collapsed position and size
- [ ] trigger buttons on hotkey release not hotkey press for CMD-OPT hotkeys (only - NOT record mode plain keystrokes).


- arrow icon in snippet menu says play not triangle font issue

- [ ] have topbar remote button only appear on the full electron app version and not the lite version.
- [ ] have the css transitions for panel display use animations that make use of animation speed in settings. slide down like a drawer is nice...
- [ ] have the code mirror pane be a snugger fit to the lines of code (but minimum 3 lines), but grow as code is added
- [ ] have the main window be scrollable for overflow
- [ ] top bar styling and master control panels in banner bar (target a specific container id)
- can the blue focus highlight be around the entire container with controls and code rather than just the header. There should be CSS controls on the panel as well as the header (for skins to utilise)
